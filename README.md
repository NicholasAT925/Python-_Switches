# Python-_Switches
 Learning to use switch in python

# Summary
There are 3 machine or 3 lines of code that act like a switch selection machine.
Machine 1: match-case
Machine 2: if-else
Machine 3: check is item exist in list
while process wise the 'match-case' method is the same with just writing a bunch of 'if', 'elif' and 'else'
It is much more simpler to write and do compare to other methods like the 'Dict Mapping' method
You have to write more lines of code for other method compare to the 'match-case' method
